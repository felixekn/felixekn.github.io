            In 2013, Jeff and Evan co-instructed the first synthetic biology course at the historic Cold Spring Harbor laboratory. We introduced students from a wide range of backgrounds to our recent methods for characterizing gene circuit dynamics using optogenetics. The students also helped design next generation 3D printed hardware for conducting these experiments with higher precision. The other instructors taught modules in metabolic engineering, in vitro transcription-translation (TX-TL), RNA circuit design, and mammalian synthetic biology. Additionally, leading synthetic biologists from around the country visited the course, lecturing on their research and vision and interacting informally with the students in the laboratory. We taught the course a second time in 2014, and are co-organizing the course, which has brought in several exciting new instructors, in 2015.

        <h1>Bacterial photography in the classroom</h1>
        <div class="row">

            <p>Tabor Lab researchers have adapted Jeff Tabor’s pioneering work on bacterial photography into a low-cost, easy-to-use K12 kit enabling students to create their own photographs in the classroom using engineered bacteria. 
            <br><br>
            Bacterial photographs are taken with E. coli which have been genetically engineered to sense red light and respond by producing indigo, the same dye used in blue jeans. When a culture of these E. coli are cast into molten agar and exposed to a red image, they develop a replica of the image, creating a “bacterial photograph” which lasts indefinitely.  This highly visual classroom experiment demonstrates to students core biology principles and excites them about cutting edge research and future careers in STEM fields. 
            <br><br>
            We have had great success in distributing this kit to over 500 students during the 2014/15 school year. Unfortunately due to resource constraints we have had to cease distribution to high schools for this school year. However, we are still interested in coordinating with museums and university classes, so if you represent one of those institutions please don't hesitate to contact us at contact@bactograph.org about trying out the experiment. If you are interested in keeping up to date with future developments of this next generation science kit, please send a short email to mailinglist@bactograph.org. Much more information can be found at the website linked below.  We are excited to see the impact this experiment can have on the young scientists of tomorrow!</p>
